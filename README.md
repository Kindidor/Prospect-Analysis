# Prospect-Analysis
A statistical analysis of current prospects and rookies
The plan for this project is to breakdown the specific statistics of many of the game's future stars. This will focus on prospects as well as recent rookies and their performances in their first year. By tracking basic stats such as average, RBI, wins, strikeouts and more advanced stats such as WAR, xWOBA, FIP, and more, I will be able to more accurately understand the value of certain prospects. The goal is to hopefully determine some metric to predict the future success of the top 100 prospects.
